Let us create a rational number and do things with it!
Enter a numerator: 
1
Enter a denominator (CANNOT BE 0): 
4
Here is our created rational object: 1/4

Enter your expected numerator if your rational number was negated:
-1
Enter your expected denominator if your rational number was negated:
4
Expected Negated Rational Number: -1/4
Negating the rational number 1/4...
Negated Rational Number calculated from the system: -1/4

Enter your expected numerator if your rational number was inverted:
4
Enter your expected denominator if your rational number was inverted:
-1
Expected Invert: -4/1
Inverting the rational number -1/4...
Invert calculated from the system: -4/1

Enter your expected number if you converted your rational number to a double:
-4
Expected Double: -4.0
Converting the rational number -4/1 to a double...
Double calculated from the system:
-4.0

Let us now add your rational number to a random rational number
Input 1: -4/1
Input 2 (random rational number): -7/60
Enter your expected numerator if your rational number was added to a random rational number(in this case, that is -7/60 )
-247
Enter your expected denominator if your rational number was added to a random rational number(in this case, that is -7/60 )
60
Expected Sum: -247/60
Calculating the sum of rational numbers (your rational number and a randomly generated one)...
The sum of -7/60 and -4/1 from our program is -247/60.
TLDR Sum (if denominator is not 0): -247/60
